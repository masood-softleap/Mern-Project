# Getting Started with Create React App


This MERN project implements the complete backend of a cloud notebook app. It features user authentication and note management, ensuring that users can add and manipulate only their own notes, without affecting others' notes. The backend is built using best practices and is designed to be scalable.

The frontend of the app is built with React, with a major focus on learning MERN concepts and enhancing website interaction with users. While design is not the primary focus, core React concepts are effectively implemented to ensure a robust user experience.

#Used Thunder Client for API testing
#Json web token for authentication
#Bootstrap for design
#Express Validator for inpput fields.
